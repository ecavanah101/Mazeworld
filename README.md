## Background
MazeWorld is a 3D multiply player computer game designed to evaluate teams. The Game 2 Work Grant at Iowa State University is the sponser of this research.

Researchers have designed an online maze platform that can be used to research human-agent team dynamics. In particular, the platform supports the analysis of research variables including the level of agent automation, function allocation (task responsibilities between human and agent), supervisory mode, trustworthiness, and embodiment (e.g., avatar vs. no avatar).



## Current Research
Researchers are currently collecting pilot test data and analyzing it through strategic metrics to analyze the team's performance.

## How to get involved
We are conducting a study to help evaluate a testbed for a video game.  If you participate, you will conduct a task where you work as a team with other players to complete a task in a 3d maze in Unity. Then you will experience a series of questions about your experience. The compensation scheme may be the following options: no compensation, $10/participant, or each participant gets a chance to win one of several $25 gift cards. For this iteration, compensation is dependent on performance but will be paid out in a $10 Amazon e-gift card if you perform better than (50% of participants). Overall participation lasting approximately 1 hour. You will also be asked to complete questionnaires about participation, stress, teamwork, and workload. To participate in the study, you must be 18 years of age or older and have access to a desktop or laptop computer connected to the internet. You should not participate if you have any physical conditions that would prevent you from performing a computer game. Participants will be excluded if they are unable to use a keyboard or if they have vision loss that isn't corrected (by glasses, contacts, hearing aids, etc.)

Elizabeth Cavanah is one of the undergraduate students focusing on Metrics and the recruitment/ logistics of the research
She is a 5th-year student at Iowa State University in the Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering at Iowa State University. Her current research involves predicting team behaviors and the effects of an agent within a team. Other projects of hers include adaptive training for stressors and biomechanics within a system.
